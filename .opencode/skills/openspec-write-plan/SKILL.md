Generate a detailed Superpowers implementation plan from an OpenSpec change's artifacts.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. Supports `--max-tasks N` (default 10) to control plan splitting.

**Steps**

1. **Select the change**

   If a name is provided, use it. Otherwise:
   - Infer from conversation context if the user mentioned a change
   - Auto-select if only one active change exists
   - If ambiguous, run `openspec list --json` to get available changes and prompt the user to select

   Always announce: "Using change: <name>" and how to override.

2. **Check status and load artifacts**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change '<name>' --json
   ```
   Parse the JSON to understand schema and artifact status.

   ```bash
   openspec instructions apply --change '<name>' --json
   ```
   Read all `contextFiles` (proposal, design, tasks, etc.).

   **If tasks artifact is missing or incomplete**: stop and suggest running `/opsx:propose` first.

3. **Parse tasks.md to extract task labels**

   Read the tasks file and extract all task entries with their labels (e.g., `1.1`, `2.3`). Each line matching `- [ ] <label> <description>` is a task. Record the label and description for each.

4. **Determine plan splitting**

   If `--max-tasks` is less than 1, treat as default (10). Count total tasks. If total > `--max-tasks`:
   - Calculate groups: `g = ceil(total / max-tasks)`
   - Distribute tasks evenly across groups (group sizes differ by at most 1)
   - Try to keep tasks sharing the same top-level label number (e.g., all `1.x` tasks) together (soft constraint)
   - Present the splitting plan to the user for confirmation:
     ```
     Total tasks: 21, max-tasks: 10 → 3 plans
     Plan 1: Tasks 1.1–2.3 (7 tasks)
     Plan 2: Tasks 2.4–4.1 (7 tasks)
     Plan 3: Tasks 4.2–5.3 (7 tasks)
     Proceed? [Y/n]
     ```
   - Wait for user confirmation before proceeding

5. **Call superpowers:writing-plans**

   Invoke the `superpowers:writing-plans` skill with these additional constraints:
   - Provide all OpenSpec artifacts as context (proposal, design, tasks)
   - **Skip the "Execution Handoff" section entirely** — do NOT prompt the user to choose between Subagent-Driven or Inline Execution. Do NOT invoke `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` or `superpowers:executing-plans` after plan generation. Control returns to this command for the output summary step.
   - **Require** that each generated Task includes an `<!-- openspec-task: LABEL -->` comment on the line directly preceding the `### Task N:` heading (no blank lines between), where LABEL matches the corresponding OpenSpec tasks.md label
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     <!-- openspec-task: 1.1 -->
     ### Task 1: Create HTML skeleton
     ```
   - One Superpowers task may map to exactly one OpenSpec task label
   - Multiple Superpowers tasks may share the same OpenSpec task label (when a coarse OpenSpec task maps to multiple fine-grained steps)

   **If the skill call fails** (Superpowers not installed): stop and display:
   > "Superpowers writing-plans skill not detected. Cannot create plan. Please install Superpowers first."

   Do not generate any plan files. Do not fall back to a different approach.

   **File naming:**
   - Single plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<change-name>.md`
   - Multiple plans: `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<change-name>-tasks-<first>-<last>.md`

6. **Verify mapping coverage**

   After plan generation, scan the plan file(s) for all `<!-- openspec-task: LABEL -->` annotations. Check:
   - Every OpenSpec task label has at least one corresponding plan task
   - Every plan task annotation references a label that exists in tasks.md (catch typos like `1.11` vs `1.1`)
   - If any label is missing or invalid: warn the user and offer to regenerate the plan

7. **Output summary**

   ```
   ## Plan Created

   **Change:** <change-name>
   **Plan file(s):**
   - docs/superpowers/plans/<filename>.md (N tasks)

   **Mapping coverage:** All OpenSpec tasks covered ✓

   Ready to execute! Run `/opsx:executing-plans <change-name>` to start implementation.
   This command will handle execution mode selection and sync progress back to OpenSpec tasks.
   ```

   **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT offer any other execution method. Do NOT suggest using `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` or `superpowers:executing-plans` directly. The only supported next step is `/opsx:executing-plans`.

**Guardrails**
- Change names must match `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` — reject any name with spaces, quotes, or special characters before substituting into shell commands
- Superpowers is a **hard dependency** — do not proceed without it
- Always load OpenSpec artifacts before calling superpowers:writing-plans
- Always verify mapping coverage after plan generation
- Do not modify any existing OpenSpec files
- Do not skip user confirmation for plan splitting
- Follow Superpowers plan file conventions (header, task structure, TDD steps)
- **Never** let superpowers:writing-plans perform its "Execution Handoff" — execution must go through `/opsx:executing-plans` to ensure OpenSpec task sync
